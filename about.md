Fehlhaber Consulting is a freelancing consultancy run by me, Kaj Fehlhaber. I have many years of experience in the software industry. Not only in development, but also in building agile organisations.

:fire: I'm as passionate about building teams & sharing ideas as I am with software architecture. Especially Cloud solutions and working with DevOps principles. :rocket:
