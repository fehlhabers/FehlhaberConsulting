I didn't want to put too much effort in creating a site, but at the same time create something that mirrors who I am.
I work a lot with teams, cloud architecture and backend functionality, but have never really had the urge to do any advanced frontend work. 

When I discoveres [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and that it can be hosted right out of GitHub, this fit me quite perfectly!
