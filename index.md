## :rocket: Accelerating the Cloud & DevOps Journey of teams :rocket:

Having successful development teams that have the ability to fully leverage DevOps principles and Cloud computing in your organisation requires hard work and the right people to make it happen. Teams need to be enabled to take ownership of their work, including getting the support required to take architectural decisions, recruit new team members, way of working and much more.

### **Building it up from the root**
Kaj from Fehlhaber Consulting combines a profound DevOps and agile mindset together having had leading architect roles in multiple projects & teams. Kaj often works in teams, but taking different roles depending on need. Being naturally active in CoPs, being humble and experimenting a lot are all traits that can be expected. If you're building an organisation where the maturity of teams is important, Fehlhaber Consulting can be a winning factor.


### **Technology changes - so do we**
You could say that Fehlhaber Consulting specializes in generalisation, to be ["T-shaped"](https://teashaped.dev).<br>

Yes, *Java* has been the main backbone of Kaj's experience, but with the increased focus on cloud development there are so many other technologies which have been part of the regular go-to bag: *Golang*, *Rust*, *Python* & *Bash* to name some languages. But today, it's so much more than just languages! Knowing *CI/CD* tooling, *containerization & orchestration* and working with *Infrastructure as Code (IaC)* is maybe just as important! Or, at least - that's what I think.  <br>
